= Mounted Volume

This folder is mounted as a volume into both the Norsk Studio and Norsk Media containers.  This is a volume in Docker Compose and a persistent volume in Kubernetes.

The Kubernetes example is deliberately simplistic - for example, it is assumed the mnt folder is avaible on whichever server the deployment is assigned to...

Example folder structure below:

----
mnt
└── data
   ├── bugs
   │  └── trinorsk.png
   ├── studio-save-files
   │  ├── OverlayBug.yaml
   │  ├── VisionDirector.yaml
   │  └── WhisperSubtitles.yaml
   └── whisper-models
----

== Other Files You Might Want to Mount

Basically anything that either Norsk Media or the Norsk Studio components might want to access.  For example, any Whisper langauge models etc.  The Whisper demo
assumes ggml-tiny.bin is in `mnt/data/whisper-models/`

You can get it from e.g. https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-tiny.bin.
Or run `scripts/get-whisper-tiny-model.sh`
