STUDIO_WORKING_DIRECTORY=${STUDIO_WORKING_DIRECTORY:-/mnt/data/}
# This is the directory in which all files are accessed by Studio
# relative to this, studio-save-files are where the yaml files exist
# but components may read/write to sub directories of this folder
# and it is assumed that the same directory is also mounted under the same path
# for Norsk as well, so that the same files are available (such as images, data sources, etc)
# Example folder structure below:
#
# mnt
# └── data
#    ├── bugs
#    │  └── trinorsk.png
#    ├── studio-save-files
#    │  ├── OverlayBug.yaml
#    │  ├── VisionDirector.yaml
#    │  └── WhisperSubtitles.yaml
#    └── whisper-models
# Other files you might want in there are the Whisper langauge models etc.  The Whisper demo
# assumes ggml-tiny.bin is in mnt/data/whisper-models/
# You can get it from e.g. https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-tiny.bin
# Or run scripts/get-whisper-tiny-model.sh


STUDIO_DOCUMENT=${STUDIO_DOCUMENT:-}
# If non-empty, Studio will load from its working directory and run the
# document at startup.  It also disables stop / start on the workflow

STUDIO_DOCUMENT_OVERRIDES=${STUDIO_DOCUMENT_OVERRIDES:-/mnt/data/overrides/example-overrides.yaml}
# If non-empty, Studio will use this file to override configuration using
# in the same manner as the usage of environment variables

# Media URLs that Studio publishes will start with the below
PUBLIC_URL_PREFIX=${PUBLIC_URL_PREFIX:-http://127.0.0.1:8080}

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=silly # error warning info debug silly
NODE_DEBUG=norsk # Output extra trace (e.g. gRPC messages)
