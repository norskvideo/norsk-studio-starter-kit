= Environments

This folder contains environment variable overrides that influence
Norsk Studio and Norsk Media's runtime behaviour.

Note, any changes or additions to these files are are automatically reflected in
the Docker runtime (via the env_file entries in the Docker Compose files).  For kubernetes
any additions would also need to be reflected in the norsk-deployment.yaml file
to explicitly pass through associated enviroment valiables as needed
